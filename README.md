Misc. helper routines for minetest mods

When experimenting with in-game code using the luacmd mod,
I noticed that there were fragments of code that kept popping up everywhere.
I therefore decided to write them in a persistent location instead...
and threw them in this mod.

This mod therefore contains a bunch of fairly small boilerplate functions for things I typed frequently.
Because of their size, I'm not really going to bother documenting them.
Their function is fairly obvious in most cases;
[use the source luke][1] for it cannot lie.
Access to the table of functions is performed via [modns][2].
